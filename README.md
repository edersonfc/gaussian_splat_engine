# Gaussian Splat Engine

Modern C++ implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting with CUDA acceleration.

## Overview

An implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting for educational and research purposes.Built with modern C++17, following the algorithm from the original paper with implementation details referenced from the official open-source code.

## Features

- **CUDA-accelerated Rasterization** - Tile-based rendering for real-time performance
- **Modern C++ Design** - Clean architecture with C++17 features
- **Training Pipeline** - Full forward/backward implementation with optimization

## Project Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**

Currently implementing:
- [X] Project structure
- [X] PLY file loader
- [X] Visualization (1) (3D Color Points only)
- [X] CPU rasterizer (for test)
- [X] CUDA rasterizer (forward pass)
- [X] Visualization (2) (Rendering)
- [ ] Training pipeline (backward pass)
- [ ] Optimization algorithms (Adam, SGD)

## Architecture
